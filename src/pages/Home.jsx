       Use the footer component at the end of your page to show content such as sitemap links, brand logo, social icons and more using React and Tailwind CSS

The footer component is an important section of a website where you should provide content such as sitemap links, copyright text, logo of your brand, social media account links, and more.

Get started with the examples from Flowbite React based on multiple styles, sizes, and colors by using React components and the utility classes from Tailwind CSS.

To start using the footer component you need to import it from
      <Text/>
      <Below/>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Home
